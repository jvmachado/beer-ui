# DbbeerUi

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).


## Highlights

This code uses a Server-Sent Event approach. Using a reactive programming style, it simplifies the challenge, and keep the HTTP connection clean (instead of multiple GET's to the server, the application only uses one request and subscribe to it).

The backend was develop in a simple application using Spring framework, Netty, JUnit and WebFlux (webflux is used to make the connection with front-end in a SSE approach).

## Future Work

Maybe in a version 2.0, would be nice to add a feature to load new containers through the front-end, remove the mocks (a H2DB would help) and rewrite the random temperature generator to something more realistic. 

## Questions

### What's the initial temperature in each container? 

It should start at 5ÂºC.
